# Ask4Creds
Prompt User for credentials

Ask4Creds is designed to prompt users for their credentials. It features a graphical user interface for credential input, with capabilities to validate these credentials against a domain.

The script attempts to validate credentials up to 5 times. After each unsuccessful attempt, the user is prompted again.

A timer is set to automatically close the form after a specified timeout period (30 seconds)
